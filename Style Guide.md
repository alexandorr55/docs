# *The Polytechnic* Style Guide
Updated 10/20/2019 at 8:24 pm. That's "mm/dd/yyyy," by the way.

# \#
#### 15th Street footbridge
Use *the 15th Street footbridge* on the first reference and *the footbridge* on subsequent references. Footbridge should be lowercase.

#### 24-hour
This construction is an adjective, so hyphenate it.

#### 3D, 2D, 1D
No hyphen.

#### ’86 Field
See **athletic facilities**.

#### ’87 Gym
See **athletic facilities**.

# A
#### a cappella
This word is well-established in the English language and does not need to be italicized. See [foreign language](#foreign-language) for more information.

#### abbreviations and acronyms
A few universally recognized abbreviations are required (and preferred) in some circumstances, such as TA or RA. Some others are acceptable depending on the context. But in general, do not use abbreviations or acronyms that the reader would not quickly recognize.
	
Acronyms should be capitalized with no periods in front of the letters. There should be a period at the end of abbreviations, such as Dem. for Democrat.
	
Do not follow an organization’s full name with an abbreviation or acronym in parentheses or set off by dashes. If an abbreviation or acronym would not be clear on second reference without this arrangement, do not use the abbreviation or acronym.
	
For time references, use am and pm without periods. For more help, see [time and date references](#time-and-date-references).

#### academic and administrative offices and departments
See [capitalization](#capitalization).

#### academic degrees
If mention of degrees is necessary to establish someone’s credentials, the preferred form is to avoid an abbreviation and use instead a phrase, e.g., *Harry Styles, who has a doctorate in chemical engineering...*

Use an apostrophe in bachelor’s and master’s degrees.

Use such abbreviations as B.S., M.S., Ph.D., etc. only when the need to identify many individuals by degree on first reference would make the preferred form unwieldy. Use these abbreviations only after a full name, never after just a last name.

Do not precede a name with a courtesy title for an academic degree and follow it with an abbreviation for the degree in the same reference; this is redundant. 

#### accelerated programs

#### accents
See [diacritics](#diacritics).

#### addresses
For famous addresses like *1600 Pennsylvania Ave.*, use the abbreviations Ave., Blvd., and St. In all other cases, fully spell out the street name.

For compass points used to indicate a city’s quadrants in numbered addresses, abbreviate the direction without periods, e.g., *20126 Eighth Avenue NW*.

If there is no number, then do not abbreviate, e.g., *West 57th Street*.

Spell out and capitalize *First* through *Ninth* when used as street names; use figures with two letters for *10th* and above.

Lowercase and spell out street names when used with more than one street name, e.g., *15th and Hoosick streets*. See [plural](#plural) for more information.

Always use figures for an address number,e.g., *2 Union Square*, *1999 Burdett Avenue*.

#### administration
Avoid, especially in headlines. This non-specific reference to a body at RPI is just that, non-specific. Try to get names on who approved what new policy, etc. Prefer administrator.

#### administrator

#### Admissions Building
The full name of this building is the *Nancy Deloye Fitzroy ’49 and Roland V. Fitzroy Jr. Admissions Building*, use *Admissions Building* on all references.

Note that some varsity sports teams from other universities use the nickname “The Engineers,” like MIT. See colleges for proper nicknames.

Sports stories should analyze the why of the results; avoid play-by-play accounts of games. Try to get the reactions of players, coaches, and fans (including those of the opposing team) rather than simply giving a chronology of the game. Sports stories should present objective reporting, rather than the reporter’s opinions.

For styling sports articles, reference the *AP Stylebook* sports guidelines section.

Right: 2 pm  

See [en dash](#en-dash) for correct formatting of date ranges. Never abbreviate the names on months. 

When referring to noon and midnight, do not say *12 noon* or *12 midnight*, this is redundant.

For date references, avoid such constructions as *last Tuesday* or *next Monday* when referring to days within a week before or after the date of publication. The use of the past or future tense should make such constructions redundant.

For example, if the date of issue is Wednesday, November 6, write time references as follows: *At a surprise meeting Monday, the Senate voted against the new parking proposal. The movie Jurassic Park will be the UPAC Cinema offering on Friday.*
